# Fast, accurate and scalable probabilistic data linkage

Splink is a Python package for probabilistic record linkage (entity resolution) that allows you to deduplicate and link records from datasets that lack unique identifiers.

## Key Features

⚡ **Speed:** Capable of linking a million records on a laptop in around a minute.  
🎯 **Accuracy:** Support for term frequency adjustments and user-defined fuzzy matching logic.  
🌐 **Scalability:** Execute linkage in Python (using DuckDB) or big-data backends like AWS Athena or Spark for 100+ million records.  
🎓 **Unsupervised Learning:** No training data is required for model training.  
📊 **Interactive Outputs:** A suite of interactive visualisations help users understand their model and diagnose problems.  

Splink's linkage algorithm is based on Fellegi-Sunter's model of record linkage, with various customizations to improve accuracy.

## What does Splink do?

Consider the following records that lack a unique person identifier:

![tables showing what splink does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/README/what_does_splink_do_1.drawio.png)

Splink predicts which rows link together:

![tables showing what splink does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/README/what_does_splink_do_2.drawio.png)

and clusters these links to produce an estimated person ID:

## What data does Splink work best with?

Before using Splink, input data should be standardized, with consistent column names and formatting (e.g., lowercased, punctuation cleaned up, etc.).

Splink performs best with input data containing **multiple** columns that are **not highly correlated**. For instance, if the entity type is persons, you may have columns for full name, date of birth, and city. If the entity type is companies, you could have columns for name, turnover, sector, and telephone number.

High correlation occurs when the value of a column is highly constrained (predictable) from the value of another column. For example, a 'city' field is almost perfectly correlated with 'postcode'. Gender is highly correlated with 'first name'. Correlation is particularly problematic if **all** of your input columns are highly correlated.

Splink is not designed for linking a single column containing a 'bag of words'. For example, a table with a single 'company name' column, and no other details.

## Documentation

The homepage for the Splink documentation can be found [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/). Interactive demos can be found [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/master/docs/demos), or by clicking the following Binder link:

The specification of the Fellegi Sunter statistical model behind `splink` is similar as that used in the R [fastLink package](https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink). Accompanying the fastLink package is an [academic paper](http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf) that describes this model. The [Splink documentation site](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/topic_guides/fellegi_sunter.html) and a [series of interactive articles](https://www.robinlinacre.com/probabilistic_linkage/) also explores the theory behind Splink.

The Office for National Statistics have written a [case study about using Splink](https://github.com/Data-Linkage/Splink-census-linkage/blob/main/SplinkCaseStudy.pdf) to link 2021 Census data to itself.

## Installation

Splink supports python 3.7+. To obtain the latest released version of splink you can install from PyPI using pip:

```sh
pip install splink
```

or, if you prefer, you can instead install splink using conda:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge splink
```

Should you require a more bare-bones version of Splink **without DuckDB**, please see the following area of the docs:
> [DuckDBless Splink Installation](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/installations.html#duckdb-less-installation)

## Quickstart

The following code demonstrates how to estimate the parameters of a deduplication model, use it to identify duplicate records, and then use clustering to generate an estimated unique person ID.

For more detailed tutorial, please see [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/00_Tutorial_Introduction.html).

```py
from splink.duckdb.linker import DuckDBLinker
import splink.duckdb.comparison_library as cl
import splink.duckdb.comparison_template_library as ctl
import splink.duckdb.blocking_rule_library as brl
from splink.duckdb.blocking_rule_library import block_on
from splink.datasets import splink_datasets

df = splink_datasets.fake_1000

settings = {
    "link_type": "dedupe_only",
    "blocking_rules_to_generate_predictions": [
        block_on("first_name"),
        block_on("surname"),
    ],
    "comparisons": [
        ctl.name_comparison("first_name"),
        ctl.name_comparison("surname"),
        ctl.date_comparison("dob", cast_strings_to_date=True),
        cl.exact_match("city", term_frequency_adjustments=True),
        ctl.email_comparison("email", include_username_fuzzy_level=False),
    ],
}

linker = DuckDBLinker(df, settings)
linker.estimate_u_using_random_sampling(max_pairs=1e6)

blocking_rule_for_training = block_on(["first_name", "surname"])

linker.estimate_parameters_using_expectation_maximisation(blocking_rule_for_training)

blocking_rule_for_training = block_on("dob")
linker.estimate_parameters_using_expectation_maximisation(blocking_rule_for_training)

pairwise_predictions = linker.predict()

clusters = linker.cluster_pairwise_predictions_at_threshold(pairwise_predictions, 0.95)
clusters.as_pandas_dataframe(limit=5)
